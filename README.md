Learing Project - GraphQL, Express, MongoDB and React app for creating and booking events.

Project created by following Academind's tutorial at [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51rG1x02Yyj93iypUuHYXcB_).

Indsted of GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) used GraphQLSchema objects. Also used React hooks instead of lifecycle methods.

nodemon.json env variables not working on my Windows so I'm using .env file instead.

TODO:
- Persist login
- More CRUD operations
- Error message when login failed
- Message when you registered
- Detail of event in bookings page
- Better charts
- and a lot more
